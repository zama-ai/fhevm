## About

### What is fhevm?

**fhevm** is a technology that enables confidential smart contracts on the EVM using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE).

Thanks to a breakthrough in homomorphic encryption, fhevm makes it possible to run confidential smart contracts on encrypted data, guaranteeing both confidentiality and composability with:

- **End-to-end encryption of transactions and state:** Data included in transactions is encrypted and never visible to anyone.
- **Composability and data availability on-chain:** States are updated while remaining encrypted at all times.
- **No impact on existing dApps and state:** Encrypted state co-exists alongside public one, and doesn't impact existing dApps.
  <br></br>

### Main features

- **Solidity integration:** fhevm contracts are simple solidity contracts that are built using traditional solidity tool-chains.
- **Simple developer experience:** Developers can use the `euint` data types to mark which part of their contracts should be private.
- **Programmable privacy:** All the logic for access control of encrypted states is defined by developers in their smart contracts.
- **High precision encrypted integers :** Up to 256 bits of precision for integers
- **Full range of operators :** All typical operators are available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `<`, `>`, `==`, â€¦
- **Encrypted if-else conditionals :** Check conditions on encrypted states
- **On-chain PRNG :** Generate secure randomness without using oracles
- **Configurable decryption :** Threshold, centralized or KMS decryption
- **Unbounded compute Depth :** Unlimited consecutive FHE operations

_Learn more about fhevm features in the [documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/fhevm)._

### Use cases

FhEVM is built for developers to write confidential smart contracts without the need to learn cryptography. Leveraging fhevm, you can unlock a myriad of new use cases such as DeFi, gaming, and more. For instance:

- **Confidential transfers**: Keep balances and amounts private, without using mixers.
- **Tokenization**: Swap tokens and RWAs on-chain without others seeing the amounts.
- **Blind auctions**: Bid on items without revealing the amount or the winner.
- **On-chain games**: Keep moves, selections, cards, or items hidden until ready to reveal.
- **Confidential voting**: Prevents bribery and blackmailing by keeping votes private.
- **Encrypted DIDs**: Store identities on-chain and generate attestations without ZK.
