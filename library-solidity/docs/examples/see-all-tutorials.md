## Solidity smart contracts templates - `fhevm-contracts`

The [fhevm-contracts repository](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-contracts) provides a comprehensive collection of secure, pre-tested Solidity templates optimized for fhevm development. These templates leverage the FHE library to enable encrypted computations while maintaining security and extensibility.

The library includes templates for common use cases like tokens and governance, allowing developers to quickly build confidential smart contracts with battle-tested components. For detailed implementation guidance and best practices, refer to the [contracts standard library guide](../smart_contracts/contracts.md).

#### Token

- [ConfidentialERC20](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/token/ERC20/ConfidentialERC20.sol): Standard ERC20 with encryption.
- [ConfidentialERC20Mintable](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ConfidentialERC20Mintable.sol): ERC20 with minting capabilities.
- [ConfidentialERC20WithErrors](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ConfidentialERC20WithErrors.sol): ERC20 with integrated error handling.
- [ConfidentialERC20WithErrorsMintable](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ConfidentialERC20WithErrorsMintable.sol): ERC20 with both minting and error handling.

#### Governance

- [ConfidentialERC20Votes](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/governance/ConfidentialERC20Votes.sol): Confidential ERC20 governance token implementation. [It is based on Comp.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Governance/Comp.sol).
- [ConfidentialGovernorAlpha](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/governance/ConfidentialGovernorAlpha.sol): A governance contract for managing proposals and votes. [It is based on GovernorAlpha.sol](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/master/contracts/Governance/GovernorAlpha.sol).

#### Utils

- [EncryptedErrors](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-contracts/blob/main/contracts/utils/EncryptedErrors.sol): Provides error management utilities for encrypted contracts.

## Code examples on GitHub

- [Blind Auction](https://github.com/zama-ai/dapps/tree/main/hardhat/contracts/auctions): A smart contract for conducting blind auctions where bids are encrypted and the winning bid remains private.
- [Decentralized ID](https://github.com/zama-ai/dapps/tree/main/hardhat/contracts/decIdentity): A blockchain-based identity management system using smart contracts to store and manage encrypted personal data.
- [FheWordle](https://github.com/zama-ai/dapps/tree/main/hardhat/contracts/fheWordle): A privacy-preserving implementation of the popular word game Wordle where players guess a secret encrypted word through encrypted letter comparisons.
- [Cipherbomb](https://github.com/immortal-tofu/cipherbomb): A multiplayer game where players must defuse an encrypted bomb by guessing the correct sequence of numbers.
- [Voting example](https://github.com/allemanfredi/suffragium): Suffragium is a secure, privacy-preserving voting system that combines zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to create a trustless and tamper-resistant voting platform.

## Frontend examples

- [Cipherbomb UI](https://github.com/immortal-tofu/cipherbomb-ui): A multiplayer game where players must defuse an encrypted bomb by guessing the correct sequence of numbers.
