**FHEVM**  
A framework enabling confidential smart contracts on EVM-compatible chains using FHE.

**Coprocessor**  
An off-chain component that executes FHE computations and returns results.

**KMS (Key Management Service)**  
A system responsible for generating, storing, and controlling access to cryptographic keys.

**Gateway contracts**
