S02: deploy --network testnet --only minio
- Deploy command recognized and parsed correctly: PASS
- --only minio accepted: PASS  
- --network testnet accepted: PASS
- Version scraping from Grafana dashboard: FAIL - puppeteer/chromium fails running as root without --no-sandbox
- Docker project name validation: FAIL - uppercase letters in FHEVM_DOCKER_PROJECT rejected by docker compose
- NOTE: '--no-tracing' is not a recognized flag; deploy has no tracing toggle
- NOTE: Tracing is handled by separate docker-compose file, not integrated into deploy command
- Actual error: 'Failed to scrape public Grafana dashboard DOM' - versions cannot be fetched
- Root cause: Chromium refuses to run as root; this is an environment constraint but CLI should handle gracefully
