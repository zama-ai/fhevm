# Environment variables

This section describes the environment variables used for deployment. A complete example of an expected `.env` file is given in the [`.env.example`](../../../.env.example) file.

Environment variables can be separated in 3 categories:

- [`GatewayConfig` values](./env_variables.md#gatewayconfig-values)
- [`KmsManagement` parameters](./env_variables.md#kmsmanagement-parameters)
- [Deployment settings](./env_variables.md#deployment-settings)

Except for deployment settings, the values are then stored in the deployed contracts and are not always allowed to be updated after. In the following, the values are given as examples. Most of them are from the `.env.example` file and are used for local testing. The expected types are also given as comments and should be respected, else the deployment is expected to fail.

Besides, the accounts found in the `.env.example` file are already-funded hardhat accounts generated with the following command:

```bash
make get-accounts
```

## Summary

Here's the complete list of environment variables used for deploying the fhevm gateway. More detailed information can be found in [this section](#in-details) below. Solidity types are defined in [Solidity's documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/types.html).

| Environment Variable                | Description                                  | Solidity Type | Default                                                                                             | Comment                                                                       |

## In details

### GatewayConfig values

These values are crucial for the fhevm Gateway protocol and are set in the `GatewayConfig` contract at deployment for most of them. To understand what each value is used for, please refer to the [GatewayConfig](../contracts/gateway_config.md) documentation.

#### At deployment

The following values are set at deployment.

- Protocol metadata:

```bash
PROTOCOL_NAME="Protocol" # (string)
PROTOCOL_WEBSITE="https://protocol.com" # (string)
```

- Pauser:

```bash
PAUSER_ADDRESS="0xa44366bAA26296c1409AD1e284264212029F02f1" # (address)
```

- KMS Thresholds:

```bash
MPC_THRESHOLD="1" # (uint256)
```

`MPC_THRESHOLD` must be less or equal to the number of KMS nodes registered below.

```bash
PUBLIC_DECRYPTION_THRESHOLD="3" # (uint256)
USER_DECRYPTION_THRESHOLD="3" # (uint256)
```

`PUBLIC_DECRYPTION_THRESHOLD` and `USER_DECRYPTION_THRESHOLD` must be non-null and less or equal to the number of KMS nodes registered below.

In practice in the fhevm protocol, they are set to values using the following formulas:

- public decryption threshold: `floor(n/2) + 1`
- user decryption threshold: `2*t + 1`

With `n` the number of KMS nodes registered below and `t` the MPC threshold.

These values might change in the future.

- KMS Nodes:

```bash
NUM_KMS_NODES="1" # (number)
```

`NUM_KMS_NODES` is the number of KMS nodes to register in the `GatewayConfig` contract. It it not stored in it and is only used within the deployment script. The following metadata variables must be set for each KMS node, indexed by a node number starting from 0. If not enough variables are set, the deployment will fail. If, on the contrary, too many variables are set, the deployment will succeed but the extra ones will be ignored.

```bash
KMS_TX_SENDER_ADDRESS_0="0xc1d91b49A1B3D1324E93F86778C44a03f1063f1b" # (address)
KMS_SIGNER_ADDRESS_0="0x305F1F471e9baCFF2b3549F9601f9A4BEafc94e1" # (address)
KMS_NODE_IP_ADDRESS_0="127.0.0.1" # (string)
```

- Coprocessors:

```bash
NUM_COPROCESSORS="3" # (number)
```

`NUM_COPROCESSORS` is the number of coprocessors to register in the `GatewayConfig` contract. It it not stored in it and is only used within the deployment script. The following metadata variables must be set for each coprocessor, indexed by a coprocessor number starting from 0. If not enough variables are set, the deployment will fail. If, on the contrary, too many variables are set, the deployment will succeed but the extra ones will be ignored.

```bash
COPROCESSOR_TX_SENDER_ADDRESS_0="0x6518D50aDc9036Df37119eA465a8159E34417E2E" # (address)
COPROCESSOR_SIGNER_ADDRESS_0="0xa5eE8292dA52d8234248709F3E217ffEBA5E8312" # (address)
COPROCESSOR_S3_BUCKET_URL_0="s3://bucket-1" # (string)
```

#### After deployment

The following values are set after deployment in a separate script. However, they are still necessary for the fhevm Gateway protocol to be fully functional.

- Host chains:

```bash
NUM_HOST_CHAINS="1" # (number)
```

`NUM_HOST_CHAINS` is the number of host chains to register in the `GatewayConfig` contract. It it not stored in it and is only used within the deployment script. The following metadata variables must be set for each host chain, indexed by a host chain number starting from 0. If not enough variables are set, the script will fail. If, on the contrary, too many variables are set, the script will succeed but the extra ones will be ignored.

```bash
HOST_CHAIN_CHAIN_ID_0="2025" # (uint256)
HOST_CHAIN_FHEVM_EXECUTOR_0="0xbb8ab3d75fd306ce85c90e899a2db850490cd697" # (address)
HOST_CHAIN_ACL_ADDRESS_0="0xabcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12" # (address)
HOST_CHAIN_NAME_0="Host chain 2025" # (string)
HOST_CHAIN_WEBSITE_0="https://host-chain-2025.com" # (string)
```

`HOST_CHAIN_CHAIN_ID` must be different for all host chains, else the script will fail.

### KmsManagement parameters

🚧 **Important** 🚧: The `KmsManagement` contract is currently neither used nor up-to-date. It will be reworked in the future. See [this issue](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-gateway/issues/108) for more details. Still, the associated environment variables are required, else the deployment script will fail.

The following values are set in the `KmsManagement` contract at deployment.

- FHE parameters:

```bash
FHE_PARAMS_NAME="TEST" # (string)
FHE_PARAMS_DIGEST="0xd61fa44c57b6e7526a46e1072d63332ab4eb38e050fe54dd51fe995f9055c354" # (bytes32)
```

### Deployment settings

The following settings are required for deploying the contracts through hardhat:

- Deployer private key

```bash
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY="0x7136d8dc72f873124f4eded25f3525a20f6cee4296564c76b44f1d582c57640f" # (bytes32)
```

This is the private key of the deployer account, used to deploy the contracts.

- Hardhat network

```bash
HARDHAT_NETWORK="hardhat" # (string)
```

This is the network on which the contracts are expected to be deployed. Possible values are: `hardhat`, `localGateway`, `staging`, `zwsDev`, `testnet`.

- Chain ID

```bash
CHAIN_ID_GATEWAY="31337" # (uint256)
```

This is the chain ID of the network on which the contracts are expected to be deployed. It should be consistent with the `HARDHAT_NETWORK` value as such:

- `hardhat`: "31337
- `localGateway`: 123456
- `staging`: 54321
- `zwsDev`: 412346
- `testnet`: 55815

- Mnemonic

```bash
MNEMONIC="adapt mosquito move limb mobile illegal tree voyage juice mosquito burger raise father hope layer" # (string)
```

This is the mnemonic used to generate the addresses and public keys of the deployer.

- RPC URL

```bash
RPC_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8757" # (string)
```

This is the URL of the RPC node for the fhevm gateway network.

#### After deploying contracts in production

Some additional settings are needed after deploying the contracts in a production setting.

- GatewayConfig address

```bash
GATEWAY_CONFIG_ADDRESS="0xC7D45661a345eC5cA0e8521CFEF7e32FDA0Daa68" # (address)
```

This (static) address is needed for adding host chains to the GatewayConfig contract separately. In a proper production setting, this environment variable needs to be dynamically set after deploying the contracts.
