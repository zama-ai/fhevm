# Triggered by:
# 1. @claude mention in PR comments (e.g., "@claude review this function")
# 2. PR synchronize event (TEMPORARY - for testing on feature branch)
#
# How prompt extraction works:
# - For comments: The action's `extractUserRequest` function automatically
#   extracts text AFTER "@claude". Example: "@claude review auth" → "review auth"
# - For pull_request: Uses a fixed prompt to review the PR
#
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/src/utils/extract-user-request.ts
#
# Security: Only users with write/admin permissions can trigger Claude.
# External contributors (fork PRs) are automatically blocked by the action.
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/src/github/validation/permissions.ts
