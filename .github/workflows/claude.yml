name: claude-review

# Triggered by: @claude mention in PR comments (e.g., "@claude review this function")
#
# How prompt extraction works:
# The action's `extractUserRequest` function automatically extracts text AFTER "@claude".
# Example: "@claude review auth" → "review auth"
#
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/src/utils/extract-user-request.ts
#
# Security: Only users with write/admin permissions can trigger Claude.
# External contributors (fork PRs) are automatically blocked by the action.
# See: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/blob/main/src/github/validation/permissions.ts
#
# Secrets required:
# - CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: OAuth token from `claude setup-token`
#
# Note: Private marketplaces are cloned in a separate step using the default GITHUB_TOKEN,
# then passed to the action as local paths to avoid authentication issues with the action's git setup
