# Use shallow install strategy to prevent npm from hoisting all dependencies to the root.
# This ensures packages like @openzeppelin/foundry-upgrades are installed in their
# respective workspace node_modules directories, which is required for Foundry to
# properly resolve Solidity imports and their nested dependencies.
