# Quick Start Tutorial

This tutorial guides you to start quickly with Zama’s **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology for building confidential smart contracts.

## What You’ll Learn

In **about 30 minutes**, you'll go from a basic Solidity contract to a fully confidential one using **FHEVM**. Here's what you'll do:

1. Set up your development environment
2. Write a simple Solidity smart contract
3. Convert it into an FHEVM-compatible confidential contract

## Prerequisite

- A basic understanding of **Solidity** library and **Ethereum**.
- Some familarity with **Hardhat.**
