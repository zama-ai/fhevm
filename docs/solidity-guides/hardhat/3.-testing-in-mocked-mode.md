# 3. Testing in mocked mode

This tutorial walks you through performing tests in the **mocked** mode provided by the fhevm Hardhat template.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- A configured Hardhat project using the fhevm Hardhat template. (See the [previous section](1.-setting-up-hardhat.md))
- Basic knowledge of Solidity and Hardhat testing. (See the [Hardhat testing documentation](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/guides/test-contracts))

{% hint style="info" %}
fhevm provides a **mocked mode** in Hardhat that allows for:

- Faster testing on a local Hardhat network.
- The ability to analyze code coverage.
- A simulated version of encrypted types (they are not truly encrypted).
- Access to Hardhat features such as snapshots (`evm_snapshot`), time manipulation (`evm_increaseTime`), and debugging (`console.log`).

To learn more about the fhevm **mocked** mode, refer to the README in the [fhevm Hardhat template repository](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-hardhat-template).
{% endhint %}

## Running your tests

To run tests in **mocked mode**, open a terminal in your project's root directory and execute:

```
# Using npm
npm run test

# Using yarn
yarn test

# Using pnpm
pnpm test
```

This command runs all tests locally in mocked mode. You should see the test results in your console.

Refer to the [[Smart contract - Mocked mode]](../../../smart_contracts/mocked.md) guide for more detailed instructions on how mocked mode works.

## Next steps

For most development and demonstration scenarios, mocked mode is sufficient. However, for production-ready development and a real testing environment, you need to run your tests on a real network where the coprocessor is deployed for example Sepolia. Refer to the [next section](4.-deploying-the-contract.md) on how to deploy your contract on Sepolia test network.
