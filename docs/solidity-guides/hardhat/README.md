# Hardhat

This tutorial covers the essential steps to quickly write and deploy a confidential ERC20 smart contract using the [fhevm Hardhat template](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-hardhat-template).

Hardhat is a flexible, extensible development environment for Ethereum, providing a robust toolkit for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts. With Zama’s fhevm integration, you can develop confidential ERC20 contracts locally and then seamlessly deploy them to a real fhevm node.

**In this tutorial, you will learn to:**

1. Set up a Hardhat project with the [**fhevm Hardhat Template**](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm-hardhat-template).
2. Write confidential contracts utilizing encrypted data types.
3. Test your contracts in **mocked mode** (for rapid feedback and coverage).
4. Deploy your confidential ERC20 contract to the Sepolia test network.
5. Interact with your deployed contract, including performing encrypted transfers.

By following these steps, you’ll get familiar with the complete development workflow using Hardhat, and be able to build, test and deploy confidential ERC20 smart contracts on Sepolia testnet.
