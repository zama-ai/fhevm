This section will guide you through writing and testing FHEVM smart contracts in Solidity using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org).

## The FHEVM Hardhat Plugin

To write FHEVM smart contracts using Hardhat, you need to install the [FHEVM Hardhat Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fhevm/hardhat-plugin) in your Hardhat project.

This plugin enables you to develop, test, and interact with FHEVM contracts right out of the box.

It extends Hardhatâ€™s functionality with a complete FHEVM API that allows you:

- Encrypt data
- Decrypt data
- Run tests using various FHEVM execution modes

## Where to go next

ðŸŸ¨ Go to [**Setup Hardhat**](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/solidity-guides/getting-started/setup) to initialize your FHEVM Hardhat project.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to [**Write FHEVM Tests in Hardhat**](write_test.md) for details on writing tests of FHEVM smart contracts using Hardhat.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to [**Run FHEVM Tests in Hardhat**](run_test.md) to learn how to execute those tests in different FHEVM environments.
