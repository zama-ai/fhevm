# 2. Writing contracts

This document explains how to write confidential smart contract using fhevm in Hardhat projects.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:

- A working Hardhat environment set up (see [previous section](1.-setting-up-hardhat.md)).
- Basic knowledge of Solidity.
- An understanding of ERC20 tokens.

## Understanding the example contract

The Hardhat template includes an example contract in the `contracts/` folder - `MyConfidentialERC20.sol`. This contract enables:

- Private ERC20 token transfers.
- Encrypted balances.
- Minting functionality for authorized addresses.

Let's break down the contract.

### Step 1. Importing required libraries and contracts.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import "fhevm/lib/FHE.sol";
import "fhevm/config/ZamaFHEVMConfig.sol";
import "fhevm-contracts/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ConfidentialERC20Mintable.sol";
```

- **`FHE.sol`**: The core Solidity library of fhevm. It enables encrypted data type like `euint64`, secures encrypted operations, such as addition and comparison and allows access control.
- **`SepoliaZamaFHEVMConfig`**: A configuration contract that automatically sets up the required configurations for real-time encrypted operations on the Sepolia testnet.
- **`ConfidentialERC20Mintable.sol`** : The confidential smart contract that allows for full ERC20 compatibility with FHE encryption.

### Step 2. Contract construction

```solidity
contract MyConfidentialERC20 is SepoliaZamaFHEVMConfig, ConfidentialERC20Mintable {
  constructor(string memory name_, string memory symbol_) ConfidentialERC20Mintable(name_, symbol_, msg.sender) {}
}
```

- This contract inherits `SepoliaZamaFHEVMConfig` and `ConfidentialERC20Mintable`.
- The constructor initializes the ERC20 token with a name and symbol, setting the deployer as the initial owner.

## Going further

This is a simple basic contract that we will deploy and use in this tutorial. To write more complex confidential smart contracts or customize your own functions:

- Explore the full range of fhevm capabilities in the [**Smart Contract**](../../../smart_contracts/key_concepts.md) section.
- Use the **`fhevm-contracts`** library and extend from the basic contract templates.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **fhevm-contracts** is a Solidity library designed for developers to easily develop confidential smart contracts using fhevm. It provides:

- **Ready-to-use confidential contracts**: Pre-built implementations of common token standards with FHE capabilities
- **Base contracts**: Foundational building blocks for creating custom confidential smart contracts
- **Extensions**: Additional features and utilities that can be added to base contracts
- **Testing utilities**: Tools to help test FHE-enabled smart contracts

See more details in [the fhevm-contracts documentation](../../../smart_contracts/contracts.md).

Your contract is ready! Let's move on to testing and deployment.
