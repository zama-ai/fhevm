# Remix

This tutorial covers the essentials steps to quickly write and deploy confidential ERC20 smart contract using the Zama Plug in.

Remix is a powerful in-browser IDE for Ethereum smart contract development. It offers a fast, intuitive way to write and deploy confidential ERC20 contracts using Zama’s fhevm plugin—no local setup required.

**In this tutorial, you will learn to:**

1. Set up Remix for fhevm development.
2. Connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to Remix.
3. Deploy a **ConfidentialERC20** contract.
4. Interact with your deployed contract directly in the Remix interface.

By the end, you’ll have a working confidential ERC20 token on Sepolia network and know how to perform encrypted transactions.&#x20;
