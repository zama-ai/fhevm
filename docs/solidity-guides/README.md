# Overview

**Welcome to Solidity Guides!**

This section will guide you through writing confidential smart contracts in Solidity using the FHEVM library. With Fully Homomorphic Encryption(FHE), your contracts can operate directly on encrypted data without ever decrypting it onchain.

## Where to go next

If you’re new to the Zama Protocol, start with the [Litepaper](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/zama-protocol-litepaper) or the [Protocol Overview](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol) to understand the foundations.

Otherwise:

🟨 Go to [**What is FHEVM**](getting-started/overview.md) to learn about the core concepts and features.

🟨 Go to [**Quick Start Tutorial**](getting-started/quick-start-tutorial/README.md) to build and test your first confidential smart contract.

🟨 Go to [**Smart Contract Guides**](configure.md) for details on encrypted types, supported operations, inputs, ACL, and decryption flows.

🟨 Go to [**Development Guides**](hardhat/README.md) to set up your local environment with Hardhat or Foundry and deploy FHEVM contracts.

🟨 Go to [**Migration Guide**](migration.md) if you're upgrading from a previous version to v0.7.
