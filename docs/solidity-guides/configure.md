# Configuration

This document explains how to enable encrypted computations in your smart contract by setting up the `fhevm` environment. Learn how to integrate essential libraries, configure encryption, and add secure computation logic to your contracts.

## Core configuration setup

To utilize encrypted computations in Solidity contracts, you must configure the **FHE library** and **Gateway addresses**. The `fhevm` package simplifies this process with prebuilt configuration contracts, allowing you to focus on developing your contractâ€™s logic without handling the underlying cryptographic setup.

## Key components configured automatically

1. **FHE library**: Sets up encryption parameters and cryptographic keys.
2. **Gateway**: Manages secure cryptographic operations, including reencryption and decryption.
3. **Network-specific settings**: Adapts to local testing, testnets (Sepolia for example), or mainnet deployment.

By inheriting these configuration contracts, you ensure seamless initialization and functionality across environments.

## ZamaFHEVMConfig.sol

This configuration contract initializes the **fhevm environment** with required encryption parameters.

**Import based on your environment:**

```solidity
// For Ethereum Sepolia
import { SepoliaZamaFHEVMConfig } from "fhevm/config/ZamaFHEVMConfig.sol";
```

**Purpose:**

- Sets encryption parameters such as cryptographic keys and supported ciphertext types.
- Ensures proper initialization of the fhevm environment.

**Example: using Sepolia configuration**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause-Clear
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import { SepoliaZamaFHEVMConfig } from "fhevm/config/ZamaFHEVMConfig.sol";

contract MyERC20 is SepoliaZamaFHEVMConfig {
  constructor() {
    // Additional initialization logic if needed
  }
}
```

## ZamaGatewayConfig.sol

To perform decryption or reencryption, your contract must interact with the **Gateway**, which acts as a secure bridge between the blockchain, coprocessor, and Key Management System (KMS).

**Import based on your environment**

```solidity
// For Ethereum Sepolia
import { SepoliaZamaGatewayConfig } from "fhevm/config/ZamaGatewayConfig.sol";
```

**Purpose**

- Configures the Gateway for secure cryptographic operations.
- Facilitates reencryption and decryption requests.

**Example: Configuring the gateway with Sepolia settings**

```solidity
import "fhevm/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaZamaFHEVMConfig } from "fhevm/config/ZamaFHEVMConfig.sol";
import { SepoliaZamaGatewayConfig } from "fhevm/config/ZamaGatewayConfig.sol";
import "fhevm/gateway/GatewayCaller.sol";

contract Test is SepoliaZamaFHEVMConfig, SepoliaZamaGatewayConfig, GatewayCaller {
  constructor() {
    // Gateway and fhevm environment initialized automatically
  }
}
```

## Using `isInitialized`

The `isInitialized` utility function checks whether an encrypted variable has been properly initialized, preventing unexpected behavior due to uninitialized values.

**Function signature**

```solidity
function isInitialized(T v) internal pure returns (bool)
```

**Purpose**

- Ensures encrypted variables are initialized before use.
- Prevents potential logic errors in contract execution.

**Example: Initialization Check for Encrypted Counter**

```solidity
require(FHE.isInitialized(counter), "Counter not initialized!");
```

## Summary

By leveraging prebuilt configuration contracts like `ZamaFHEVMConfig.sol` and `ZamaGatewayConfig.sol`, you can efficiently set up your smart contract for encrypted computations. These tools abstract the complexity of cryptographic initialization, allowing you to focus on building secure, confidential smart contracts.
