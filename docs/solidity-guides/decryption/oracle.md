# Oracle

This section explains how to handle decryption in fhevm. Decryption allows plaintext data to be accessed when required
for contract logic or user presentation, ensuring confidentiality is maintained throughout the process.

{% hint style="info" %} Understanding how encryption, user decryption, and public decryption works is a prerequisite
before implementation, see
[Encryption, User Decryption, Public Decryption, and Computation](../../protocol/d_re_ecrypt_compute.md). {% endhint %}

Decryption is essential in two primary cases:

1. **Smart contract logic**: A contract requires plaintext values for computations or decision-making.
2. **User interaction**: Plaintext data needs to be revealed to all users, such as revealing the decision of the vote.

To learn how decryption works see
[Encryption, User decryption, Public decryption, and Computation](../../protocol/d_re_ecrypt_compute.md).

## Overview

Decryption in FHEVM is an asynchronous process that involves the Relayer and Key Management System (KMS). Hereâ€™s an
example of how to safely request decryption in a contract.

### Example: asynchronous decryption in a contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";

contract TestAsyncDecrypt is SepoliaConfig {
  ebool xBool;
  bool public yBool;
  bool isDecryptionPending;
  uint256 latestRequestId;

  constructor() {
    xBool = FHE.asEbool(true);
    FHE.allowThis(xBool);
  }

  function requestBool() public {
    require(!isDecryptionPending, "Decryption is in progress");
    bytes32[] memory cts = new bytes32[](1);
    cts[0] = FHE.toBytes32(xBool);
    uint256 latestRequestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.myCustomCallback.selector);

    /// @dev This prevents sending multiple requests before the first callback was sent.
    isDecryptionPending = true;
  }

  function myCustomCallback(uint256 requestId, bool decryptedInput, bytes[] memory signatures) public returns (bool) {
    /// @dev This check is used to verify that the request id is the expected one.
    require(requestId == latestRequestId, "Invalid requestId");
    FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, signatures);
    yBool = decryptedInput;
    isDecryptionPending = false;
    return yBool;
  }
}
```

## Decryption in depth

This document provides a detailed guide on implementing decryption in your smart contracts using the `DecryptionOracle`
in fhevm. It covers the setup, usage of the `FHE.requestDecryption` function, and testing with Hardhat.

## `DecryptionOracle` setup

The `DecryptionOracle` is pre-deployed on the FHEVM testnet. It uses a default relayer account specified in the `.env`
file.

Anyone can fulfill decryption requests but it is essential to add signature verification (and to include a logic to
invalidate the replay of decryption requests). The role of the `DecryptionOracle` contract is to independently verify
the KMS signature during execution. This ensures that the relayers cannot manipulate or send fraudulent decryption
results, even if compromised.

There are two functions to consider: `requestDecryption` and `checkSignatures`.

### `FHE.requestDecryption` function

You can call the function `FHE.requestDecryption` as such:

```solidity
function requestDecryption(
  bytes32[] calldata ctsHandles,
  bytes4 callbackSelector
) external payable returns (uint256 requestId);
```

#### Function arguments

The first argument, `ctsHandles`, should be an array of ciphertexts handles which could be of different types, i.e
`uint256` values coming from unwrapping handles of type either `ebool`, `euint8`, `euint16`, `euint32`, `euint64` or
`eaddress`.&#x20;

`ctsHandles` is the array of ciphertexts that are requested to be decrypted. Tthe relayer will send the corresponding
ciphertexts to the KMS for decryption before fulfilling the request.

`callbackSelector` is the function selector of the callback function, which will be called once the relayer fulfils the
decryption request.

```solidity
function [callbackName](uint256 requestID, XXX x_0, XXX x_1, ..., XXX x_N-1, bytes[] memory signatures) external;
```

Notice that `XXX` should be the decrypted type, which is a native Solidity type corresponding to the original ciphertext
type, following this table of conventions:

| Ciphertext type | Decrypted type |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| ebool           | bool           |
| euint8          | uint8          |
| euint16         | uint16         |
| euint32         | uint32         |
| euint64         | uint64         |
| euint128        | uint128        |
| euint256        | uint256        |
| eaddress        | address        |

Here `callbackName` is a custom name given by the developer to the callback function, `requestID` will be the request id
of the decryption (could be commented if not needed in the logic, but must be present) and `x_0`, `x_1`, ... `x_N-1` are
the results of the decryption of the `ct` array values, i.e their number should be the size of the `ct` array.

`msgValue` is the value in native tokens to be sent to the calling contract during fulfillment, i.e when the callback
will be called with the results of decryption.

> _**WARNING:**_ Notice that the callback should always verify the signatures and implement a replay protection
> mechanism (see below).

### `FHE.checkSignatures` function

You can call the function `FHE.checkSignatures` as such:

```solidity
function checkSignatures(uint256 requestId, bytes[] memory signatures);
```

#### Function arguments

The first argument, `requestID`, is the value that was returned in the `requestDecryption`function. The second argument,
`signatures`, is an array of signatures from the KMS signers.

This function reverts if the signatures are invalid.
