# Decryption

This section explains how to handle decryption in fhevm. Decryption allows plaintext data to be accessed when required for contract logic or user presentation, ensuring confidentiality is maintained throughout the process.

Understanding how encryption, decryption and reencryption works is a prerequisite before implementation, see [Encryption, Decryption, Re-encryption, and Computation](../../introductions/d_re_ecrypt_compute.md).
{% endhint %}

Decryption is essential in two primary cases:

1. **Smart contract logic**: A contract requires plaintext values for computations or decision-making.
2. **User interaction**: Plaintext data needs to be revealed to all users, such as revealing the decision of the vote.

To learn how decryption works see [Encryption, Decryption, Re-encryption, and Computation](../../introductions/d_re_ecrypt_compute.md).

## Overview

Decryption in FHEVM is an asynchronous process that involves the Relayer and Key Management System (KMS).
Hereâ€™s an example of how to safely request decryption in a contract.

### Example: asynchronous decryption in a contract

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import "@fhevm/solidity/lib/FHE.sol";
import { SepoliaConfig } from "@fhevm/solidity/config/ZamaConfig.sol";

contract TestAsyncDecrypt is SepoliaConfig {
  ebool xBool;
  bool public yBool;
  bool isDecryptionPending;
  uint256 latestRequestId;

  constructor() {
      xBool = FHE.asEbool(true);
      FHE.allowThis(xBool);
  }

  function requestBool() public {
    require(!isDecryptionPending, "Decryption is in progress");
    uint256[] memory cts = new uint256[](1);
    cts[0] = FHE.toUint256(xBool);
    uint256 latestRequestId = FHE.requestDecryption(cts, this.myCustomCallback.selector);

    /// @dev This prevents sending multiple requests before the first callback was sent.
    isDecryptionPending = true;
  }

  function myCustomCallback(uint256 requestId, bool decryptedInput, bytes[] memory signatures) public returns (bool) {
    /// @dev This check is used to verify that the request id is the expected one.
    require(requestId == latestRequestId, "Invalid requestId");
    FHE.checkSignatures(requestId, signatures);
    yBool = decryptedInput;
    isDecryptionPending = false;
    return yBool;
  }
}
```
