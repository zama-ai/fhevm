# Decryption in depth

This document provides a detailed guide on implementing decryption in your smart contracts using the `DecryptionOracle` in fhevm. It covers the setup, usage of the `FHE.requestDecryption` function, and testing with Hardhat.

## `DecryptionOracle` setup

The `DecryptionOracle` is pre-deployed on the FHEVM testnet. It uses a default relayer account specified in the `.env` file.

Anyone can fulfill decryption requests but it is essential to add signature verification (and to include a logic to invalidate the replay of decryption requests). The role of the `DecryptionOracle` contract is to independently verify the KMS signature during execution. This ensures that the relayers cannot manipulate or send fraudulent decryption results, even if compromised.

There are two functions to consider: `requestDecryption` and `checkSignatures`.

### `FHE.requestDecryption` function

You can call the function `FHE.requestDecryption` as such:

```solidity
    function requestDecryption(bytes32[] calldata ctsHandles, bytes4 callbackSelector) external payable returns (uint256 requestId);
```

#### Function arguments

The first argument, `ctsHandles`, should be an array of ciphertexts handles which could be of different types, i.e `uint256` values coming from unwrapping handles of type either `ebool`, `euint8`, `euint16`, `euint32`, `euint64` or `eaddress`.&#x20;

`ctsHandles` is the array of ciphertexts that are requested to be decrypted. Tthe relayer will send the corresponding ciphertexts to the KMS for decryption before fulfilling the request.

`callbackSelector` is the function selector of the callback function, which will be called once the relayer fulfils the decryption request.

```solidity
function [callbackName](uint256 requestID, XXX x_0, XXX x_1, ..., XXX x_N-1, bytes[] memory signatures) external;
```

Notice that `XXX` should be the decrypted type, which is a native Solidity type corresponding to the original ciphertext type, following this table of conventions:

| Ciphertext type | Decrypted type |
| --------------- | -------------- |
| ebool           | bool           |
| euint8          | uint8          |
| euint16         | uint16         |
| euint32         | uint32         |
| euint64         | uint64         |
| euint128        | uint128        |
| euint256        | uint256        |
| eaddress        | address        |

Here `callbackName` is a custom name given by the developer to the callback function, `requestID` will be the request id of the decryption (could be commented if not needed in the logic, but must be present) and `x_0`, `x_1`, ... `x_N-1` are the results of the decryption of the `ct` array values, i.e their number should be the size of the `ct` array.

`msgValue` is the value in native tokens to be sent to the calling contract during fulfillment, i.e when the callback will be called with the results of decryption.

> _**WARNING:**_ Notice that the callback should always verify the signatures and implement a replay protection mechanism (see below).

### `FHE.checkSignatures` function

You can call the function `FHE.checkSignatures` as such:

```solidity
    function checkSignatures(uint256 requestId, bytes[] memory signatures);
```

#### Function arguments

The first argument, `requestID`, is the value that was returned in the `requestDecryption`function.
The second argument, `signatures`, is an array of signatures from the KMS signers.

This function reverts if the signatures are invalid.
