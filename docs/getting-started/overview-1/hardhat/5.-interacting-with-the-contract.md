# 5. Interacting with the contract

After deploying your first **fhEVM** contract using **Hardhat**, this guide shows you how to interact with it using Hardhat tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before interacting with your deployed contract, ensure the following:

- **Deployment completed**: You have successfully deployed the `MyConfidentialERC20` contract (see previous section)
- **Contract address**: You have saved the deployed contract address
- **Sepolia ETH**: You have some Sepolia ETH in your wallet for transaction fees
- **Environment setup**: Your `.env` file is properly configured with your private key

## Step 1: Mint tokens to your account

First, let's mint some confidential tokens to your account:

```sh
# Mint 1000 tokens to your account by replacing recipient-address with your address
npx hardhat mint --to <recipient-address> --amount 1000 --network sepolia
```

Once successful, you'll see a transaction confirmation in the terminal that looks like this:

```
Starting mint process...
Contract address: 0x1...26
Minting 1000 tokens to address: 0x1...26
Transaction submitted, waiting for confirmation...
✅ Mint transaction successful!
Transaction hash: 0x1...26
1000 tokens were minted to 0x1....26
```

## Step 2: Verify total supply

You can check the total supply of tokens to confirm your mint was successful:

```sh
# Check the total supply
npx hardhat totalSupply --network sepolia
```

Once successful, you'll see a transaction confirmation in the terminal:

```
✅ Retrieved total supply successfully
----------------------------------------
Total Supply: 1000 tokens
----------------------------------------
```

## Step 3: Check your balance

To verify your account balance:

```sh
# Check your encrypted balance by replacing <private-key> with the private key of the account you want to check
# You can get the private key by running 'npx hardhat get-accounts --num-accounts 5'
npx hardhat balance --privatekey <private-key> --network sepolia
```

Note to remind yourself what was are the private keys of the accounts of the MNEMONIC SEED you can always check it by running:

```sh
npx hardhat get-accounts --num-accounts 5
```

Once successful, you'll see a transaction confirmation in the terminal.

```
✅ Retrieved balance handle successfully
----------------------------------------
Address: 0x1..59
Balance: 1000 tokens
----------------------------------------
```

## Step 4: Transfer tokens

To transfer confidential tokens to another account:

```sh
# Transfer tokens from your account to another address
# Replace <private-key> with the private key of the sending account
# Replace <recipient-address> with the destination wallet address
# Adjust the amount (100) as needed
npx hardhat transfer --privatekey <private-key> --to <recipient-address> --amount 100 --network sepolia
```

Once successful, you'll see a transaction confirmation in the terminal.

```
Starting transfer process...
Contract address: 0x1...26
From: 0x1...59
To: 0xA...4D
Amount: 100 tokens
Encrypting and proving in 9.4s
Verifying in 8.7s
Submitting transfer transaction...
Waiting for confirmation...
----------------------------------------
✅ Transfer successful!
Transaction hash: 0xc..13
Transferred 100 tokens to 0xA..4D
```

## Step 5: Verify updated balances

After the transfer, you can check both accounts balances:

```sh
# Check sender's updated balance after transfer
# Replace <private-key> with the private key of the senders account
npx hardhat balance --privatekey <private-key> --network sepolia

# Check recipient's updated balance after receiving transfer
# Replace <private-key> with the private key of the recipient account
npx hardhat balance --privatekey <private-key> --network sepolia
```

If both balances have changed accordingly the transaction was successful.

## Available Tasks

Here's a complete list of available Hardhat tasks for interacting with your contract:

- `mint`: Mint new encrypted tokens
- `transfer`: Transfer encrypted tokens to another address
- `balance`: Check encrypted balance of an account
- `totalSupply`: Get the total token supply

For detailed help on any task, run:

```sh
npx hardhat help <task-name>
```
