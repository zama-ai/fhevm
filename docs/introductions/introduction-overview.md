# 👋 Welcome to FHEVM Docs

Whether you're building confidential smart contracts, integrating privacy-preserving features into your dApp, or
contributing to the FHEVM ecosystem through research, tools, or infrastructure — the FHEVM Docs are here to guide you
through every step.

## 🔍 Where to go next?

If you're new to Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) or want a quick overview of how FHEVM brings privacy to
EVM-compatible blockchains, we recommend starting with What is FHEVM? and coming back here when you're ready.

Otherwise, pick your path:

🧑‍💻 [Go to Guides](../solidity-guides/key_concepts.md) – Learn how to write encrypted smart contracts using Solidity,
integrate the SDK, and run your first confidential app.

⚙️ Go to [Architecture](./architecture_overview.md) – Explore how the protocol works under the hood: smart contracts,
coprocessors, the relayer, and the KMS.

🧰 Go to [Tooling](../solidity-guides/solidity-overview.md) – Discover how to use the Hardhat plugin and debugging tools
designed to make FHE development seamless.

🔐 Go to [Cryptography](./fhe-on-blockchain.md) – Deep dive into FHE keys, symbolic execution, and user decryption — and
how they’re secured.

🌐 Go to [Examples](../examples/example-overview.md) – Explore apps, demos, integrations, and community projects powered
by FHEVM.
