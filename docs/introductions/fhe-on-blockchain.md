# FHE on blockchain

This page provides an overview of FHE and its implementation in the blockchain context via FHEVM. It introduces the
essential cryptographic concepts and architecture needed to start building confidential smart contracts.

## **FHE overview**

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is an advanced cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed
directly on encrypted data, without requiring decryption. This enables data to remain confidential throughout its entire
lifecycle — at rest, in transit, and during computation.

With FHE:

- Data can be securely encrypted and still usable for meaningful computation.
- Computation results are also encrypted, maintaining end-to-end confidentiality.

FHE relies on three core cryptographic keys, each with a distinct role:

### **Private key**

- **Purpose**: Decrypts ciphertexts to recover the original plaintext.
- **Usage in FHEVM**: Managed by the Key Management System (KMS) using threshold MPC, ensuring no single party ever
  holds the complete key.

### **Public key**

- **Purpose**: Encrypts plaintext inputs.
- **Usage in FHEVM**: Globally available to encrypt data from frontend apps and users.

### **Evaluation key**

- **Purpose**: Enables homomorphic operations (e.g., _add_, _mul_) on encrypted data.
- **Usage in FHEVM**: Stored on coprocessors to perform encrypted computations without exposing data.

These keys are the foundation of FHEVM’s secure computation model, enabling a system where confidentiality,
programmability, and composability can coexist.

## **FHE to Blockchain: From library to fhevm**

### **Building on Zama's FHE library**

At its core, FHEVM is powered by Zama’s high-performance FHE library, **TFHE-rs** — a Rust implementation of the Torus
Fully Homomorphic Encryption (TFHE) scheme. TFHE-rs is optimized for fast, secure computation on encrypted data, forming
the cryptographic backbone of FHEVM.

> **Info**: For detailed documentation and implementation examples on the `tfhe-rs` library, visit the
> [TFHE-rs documentation](https://docs.zama.ai/tfhe-rs).

However, integrating a standalone FHE library like TFHE-rs into a blockchain environment involves unique challenges.
Blockchain systems demand efficient processing, public verifiability, and seamless interoperability, all while
preserving their decentralized nature. To address these requirements, Zama designed the FHEVM, a system that bridges the
computational power of TFHE-rs with the transparency and scalability of blockchain technology.

### **Challenges in blockchain integration**

Integrating FHE into blockchain required solving several key problems:

1. **Transparency and privacy**: Blockchains are public by default. FHE enables privacy by keeping data encrypted
   throughout contract execution.
2. **Public verifiability**: Operations must be verifiable without revealing inputs. FHEVM uses symbolic execution and
   proofs to maintain trust.
3. **Composability**: Encrypted smart contracts must interoperate like standard ones. FHEVM allows encrypted state to be
   shared, composed, and reused across contracts.
4. **Performance and scalability**: FHE is computationally heavy. To keep contracts efficient, compute is offloaded to
   specialized nodes — coprocessors.

To overcome these challenges, Zama introduced a hybrid architecture for FHEVM that combines:

- **On-chain**
  - Smart contracts written in Solidity using encrypted types (`euint`, `ebool`, etc.).
  - Manages encrypted state and emits symbolic events to trigger off-chain execution.
- **Off-chain**
  - Coprocessors execute FHE operations using the evaluation key.
  - Results are stored off-chain, and only references (handles) are returned on-chain.
- **Relayer & KMS**

  - The relayer coordinates between the blockchain, users, and the KMS.
  - The Key Management System securely handles decryption via threshold MPC, supporting both smart contract and user
    decryption.

  This architecture provides a scalable and secure foundation for confidential, composable smart contracts — without
  modifying the EVM or breaking developer workflows.
