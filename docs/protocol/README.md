# Welcome

**Welcome to the Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol Docs.**\
The docs aim to guide you to build confidential dApps on top of any L1 or L2 using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

{% hint style="warning" %}

The Zama Protocol Testnet is not audited and is not intended for production use. **Do not publish any critical or sensitive data**. For production workloads, please wait for the Mainnet release.

{% endhint %}

## Where to go next

If you're completely new to FHE or the Zama Protocol, we suggest first checking out the [Litepaper](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/zama-protocol-litepaper), which offers a thorough overview of the protocol.

Otherwise:

ðŸŸ¨ Go to [**Quick Start**](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/solidity-guides/getting-started/quick-start-tutorial) to learn how to write your first confidential smart contract using FHEVM.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to [**Solidity Guides**](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/solidity-guides) to explore how encrypted types, operations, ACLs, and other core features work in practice.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to [**Relayer SDK Guides**](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/relayer-sdk-guides) to build a frontend that can encrypt, decrypt, and interact securely with the blockchain.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to [**FHE on Blockchain**](architecture/overview.md) to learn the architecture in depth and understand how encrypted computation flows through both on-chain and off-chain components.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to [**Examples**](https://docs.zama.ai/protocol/examples) to find reference and inspiration from smart contract examples and and dApp examples.
