# Welcome

**Welcome to the Zama Confidential Blockchain Protocol Docs.**\
The docs aim to guide you to build confidential dApps on top of any L1 or L2 using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

## Where to go next

If you're completely new to FHE or the Zama Protocol, we suggest first checking out the [Litepaper](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MIF05xPVoj0l_wnOGB7/s/Edp93qMUwAKDm540ieDj/), which offers a thorough overview of the protocol.&#x20;

Otherwise:

🟨 Go to [**Quick Start**](https://app.gitbook.com/s/rDmRmmmSrBgV0SFO4eiZ/getting-started/quick-start-tutorial) to learn how to write your first confidential smart contract using FHEVM.

🟨 Go to [**Solidity Guides**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MIF05xPVoj0l_wnOGB7/s/rDmRmmmSrBgV0SFO4eiZ/) to explore how encrypted types, operations, ACLs, and other core features work in practice.

🟨 Go to [**Relayer SDK Guides**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MIF05xPVoj0l_wnOGB7/s/Xn2WDIaMPelG4OHaUISx/) to build a frontend that can encrypt, decrypt, and interact securely with the blockchain.

🟨 Go to [**FHE on Blockchain**](architecture/overview.md) to learn the architecture in depth and understand how encrypted computation flows through both on-chain and off-chain components.

🟨 Go to [**Examples**](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MIF05xPVoj0l_wnOGB7/s/UTmYJ1UQyasGNx2K8Aqd/) to find reference and inspiration from smart contract examples and and dApp examples.
