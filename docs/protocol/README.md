# Welcome

Welcome to the Zama Protocol Documentation, your guide to building confidential applications on public blockchains using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**.

Zama Protocol enables developers to write smart contracts that compute on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This means sensitive user inputs, interactions, and outcomes can remain private onchain.

# Where to go next
If you're completely new to FHE or the Zama Protocol, we suggest first checking out the Litepaper, which offers a thorough overview of the protocol. Otherwise:

ðŸŸ¨ Go to **Quickstart** to learn how to write your first confidential smart contract using FHEVM.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to **Solidity Guides** to explore how encrypted types, operations, ACLs, and other core features work in practice.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to **Relayer SDK** to build a frontend that can encrypt, decrypt, and interact securely with the blockchain.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to **FHE on Blockchain** to learn the architecture in depth and understand how encrypted computation flows through both on-chain and off-chain components.

ðŸŸ¨ Go to **Examples** to find reference and inspiration from smart contract examples and and dApp examples.
