# Overview

The FHEVM protocol brings encrypted computation to smart contracts using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), while
preserving composability, auditability, and EVM compatibility. It is made up of five key components:

- [FHEVM Solidity Library](library.md) – lets developers write confidential smart contracts using encrypted types and
  operations, all in plain Solidity.

- [Host Contracts](hostchain.md) - trusted contracts deployed on EVM chains that manage access control and trigger
  off-chain execution.

- [Coprocessors](coprocessor.md) – decentralized services that verify encrypted inputs, run FHE computations, and commit
  results.

- [Gateway](gateway.md) – orchestrates the protocol: it validates inputs, manages ACLs, bridges ciphertexts across
  chains, and coordinates coprocessors and the KMS.

- [Key Management Service (KMS)](kms.md) – a threshold MPC network that generates and rotates FHE keys, and handles
  secure, verifiable decryption.

- [Relayer & oracle](relayer_oracle.md) – A lightweight off-chain service that helps users interact with the Gateway by
  forwarding encryption or decryption requests.
